Pong Game in Python (Using OOP and Turtle Module)
This is a simple and fun recreation of the classic Pong game using Python's turtle module and object-oriented programming (OOP). The game allows two players to control paddles, hit the ball, and keep score, while using realistic bouncing effects.

Features
Two-player mode: Control paddles on both sides of the screen using keyboard inputs.
Ball movement and bouncing: The ball moves around the screen, bouncing off paddles and walls.
Score tracking: The game keeps track of each player's score, adding a point when the opponent misses the ball.
Smooth animations: The game runs efficiently with fluid animations using the turtle module.
Object-oriented design: The game is built using OOP, making it modular, readable, and easy to maintain.
Installation
Clone the Repository
Use Git to clone the game repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pong-game.git
Navigate to the Directory
Change into the game directory:

bash
Copy code
cd pong-game
Run the Game
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. No external libraries are needed, as the turtle module is included with Python. To run the game:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
How to Play
Left Paddle:

Move Up: W key
Move Down: S key
Right Paddle:

Move Up: Up Arrow ↑
Move Down: Down Arrow ↓
The objective is to hit the ball with your paddle and prevent it from passing you. If the ball passes a paddle, the opposing player scores a point. The game continues indefinitely, and you can keep track of the score as you play.

Steps to Build the Game
Here is a breakdown of the key steps in building the Pong game using object-oriented programming and the turtle module:

1. Create the Screen
First, a game screen is created using the turtle module with dimensions that mimic a classic Pong table. The screen is black, and the animation is turned off initially to improve the game's smoothness.

2. Create and Move Paddles
Two paddle objects are created using a Paddle class. These paddles are positioned on opposite sides of the screen, and the players can control them using specific keyboard keys. The movement is vertical (up and down).

3. Create the Ball and Make It Move
A Ball class is responsible for handling the ball's behavior. The ball moves in a straight line and bounces off walls and paddles. Its movement is updated continuously throughout the game to ensure smooth animation.

4. Detect Collision with Walls and Paddles
Wall Collision: When the ball hits the top or bottom edge of the screen, it bounces back in the opposite direction, creating a realistic wall bounce effect.

Paddle Collision: When the ball gets close to a paddle, and the paddle is in the right range, the ball bounces back toward the opponent.

5. Keep Score
The game tracks and displays the score for both players. Every time a player misses the ball, the opposing player scores a point. The ball is then reset to the center of the screen, and the game continues.

Technologies Used
Python 3: The game is written entirely in Python.
Turtle Module: A built-in Python library used for graphics and animations.
